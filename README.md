# 🧼 Bayesian experimental design for determining the critical micelle concentration of a surfactant

this repo contains the Julia code used for and experimental data generated by our project: 
> M. Hammond, Q. Ke, A. Deshwal, C. Simon, A. Bain. "Adaptive, Bayesian experimental design to efficiently determine the critical micelle concentration of a surfactant" (2025)

* the Pluto.jl notebook `al_cmc.jl` contains both the code for the Bayesian inference & decision-making and the raw experimental surface tension isotherm data of the two surfactants used for our case studies. 
    * the `cmc` directory contains the Julia files necessary to reproduce the package environment. these files are used by the `Pkg.activate("cmc")` line in `al_cmc.jl`.
* the `figs` directory contains the Adobe Illustrator files comprising our figures.
* the `data` directory contains surface tension isotherm data obtained via the traditional way.
